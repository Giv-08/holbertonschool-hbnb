### Overview 👓
HBnB is a platform designed to connect property owners with potential guests, facilitating short-term rentals and unique accommodation experiences. The application encompasses several key functionalities:

User Management: Allowing users to register, update their profiles, and operate as either guests or hosts. Place Management: Enabling hosts to list their properties with details such as description, price, and location. Review System: Facilitating guest feedback through ratings and comments on their stays. Amenity Management: Associating various amenities with listed properties to enhance guest experiences.

### Technical Architecture 👩‍🏫 
The HBnB application is built on a three-layered architecture, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability:

Presentation Layer: Handles user interactions through services and API endpoints, managing input/output and user interface elements. Business Logic Layer: Contains the core models (User, Place, Review, Amenity) and implements the rules governing the platform's functionality. Persistence Layer: Manages data storage and retrieval, interfacing with the database to perform CRUD operations.

## Structure 🏔

### App 🖥
This directory contains the core Flask application and instance, which is created and served within the `init.py` script

### Persistence 🗃
This directory contains the current in-memeory persistence layer that will be replaced with a database layer in the future. The repository.py file acts as the interface or class responsible for managing data within the in-memory persistence layer. This file simulates the behavior of a database by providing methods for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data in the application’s internal storage (likely using Python data structures like dictionaries or lists)

### Services 💡
This directory contains our services that run HBnB. The facade.py implements the Facade design pattern. The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to interact with different parts of the system (Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence Layers).

### run.py 💡
This is the root file that will serve as the entry point for our AirBNB Clone. It contains the code that initializes and launches the main components, such as setting up the application server, and starting services.

### config.py ⚙️
This file contains environment-specific setting definitions.

### requirements.txt 🔑
To install the requirements to run this project run the following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run 👷🏼‍♀️
To run the project, run the following command while in the root directory
```
python3 run.py
```

### Usage 🛠
Once the application is running, you can interact with the API through some tools like Postman or cURL.

Example of Creating a New User:
```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/users/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}'
```
Example of Fetching All Places:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/places/
```

### Test 🌊
To test the project, run the following command while in the root directory
```
python3 -m unittest discover app.tests
```

### Technologies Used 💻
Python: The core language used to develop the backend. Flask: Web framework for building the API. SQLAlchemy: ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for handling database operations. MySQL: Database used for storing user, place, review, and amenity data. Unittest: For automated testing of the application.
